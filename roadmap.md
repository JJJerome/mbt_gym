# Roadmap for mbt_gym

## General additions

- [Stochastic and local volatility models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_volatility) for the midprice 
process. For example, the Heston or CEV model. 
- Hawkes processes with more general kernels for the arrival rate process.
- Robust adversarial reinforcement learning. See, for example, 
[the paper by Spooner and Savani](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01820).
